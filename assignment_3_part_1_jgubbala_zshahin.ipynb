        "YOUR ANSWER:\n",
        "\n",
        "The normalization function is built to handle two common types of observations in reinforcement learning: low-dimensional state vectors and high-dimensional image observations. It first checks whether the environment’s observation space is a Box with finite lower and upper bounds. If the space is not a Box or has infinite bounds, the function simply returns the original observation. This avoids making unsafe assumptions about unbounded or non-numeric observations and keeps the preprocessing focused on cases where scaling is well defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the observation comes from a vector-valued Box space, such as in LunarLander-v3, the function uses the environment’s low and high arrays to normalize each dimension into the range [−1, 1]. This is useful because different state variables (position, velocity, angle, leg contacts, etc.) can naturally live on very different scales. Mapping all of them into a common range helps neural networks train more smoothly: gradients are less dominated by any single large-scale feature, and learning tends to be more stable. This setup is preferred for classic control and continuous-state environments where the state is a relatively small numeric vector with meaningful physical bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "For pixel-based environments like PongNoFrameskip-v4, the observation space is a Box(0, 255, (210, 160, 3), uint8), representing RGB images. In this case, the function detects an integer Box with 0–255 bounds and normalizes by dividing by 255, which maps pixel values into the range [0, 1] while preserving the image shape. This is a standard preprocessing step in vision tasks and makes the input more suitable for gradient-based optimization, since working with large raw integers can slow down or destabilize training. This setup is preferred whenever the agent receives raw images from the environment, especially in Atari-style games.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the two setups: [−1, 1] scaling for vector states and [0, 1] scaling for pixel observations—provide a simple and practical normalization strategy that aligns with how these different types of inputs are usually handled in practice. The same function can be reused across both types of environments, reducing code duplication and making it easier to plug different tasks into the same training pipeline.\n"

        "The code uses a shared SharedActorCritic network with one optimizer step to show how gradient clipping works. The network takes an 8-dimensional observation, passes it through shared layers, and then splits into two heads: one head outputs action probabilities (actor), and the other predicts a value estimate (critic). The actor loss is computed using a policy-gradient style term with an advantage (return - value), and the critic loss is the mean-squared error between the predicted values and the target returns. These two losses are added into a single total loss, and total_loss.backward() is called so that gradients are computed for all parts of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "After backpropagation, the code calculates the global L2 norm of all gradients before clipping, applies torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=0.5), and then measures the gradient norm again. In the example run, the gradient norm starts at about 3.40 and is reduced to around 0.5 after clipping. This shows that gradient clipping is actually limiting the size of the update. This kind of setup—a shared actor–critic network with a single optimizer and gradient norm clipping—is useful in reinforcement learning when gradients can suddenly become large due to noisy returns or advantages. Clipping keeps the training step under control and helps prevent unstable updates, while still allowing the model to learn from both the actor and critic losses at the same time.\n",
